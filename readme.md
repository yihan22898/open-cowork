<a id="installation"></a>

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (macOS, Recommended)

```bash
brew tap OpenCoworkAI/tap
brew install --cask --no-quarantine open-cowork
```

> The `--no-quarantine` flag bypasses macOS Gatekeeper, so you won't see the "Apple cannot verify this app" warning.

### Option 2: Download Installer

Get the latest version from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/open-cowork/releases).

| Platform                  | File Type  |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| **Windows**               | `.exe`     |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | `.dmg`     |
| **Linux** (x64)           | `.AppImage` |

### Option 3: Build from Source

For developers who want to contribute or modify the codebase:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/open-cowork.git
cd open-cowork
npm install
npm run rebuild
npm run dev
```

To build the installer locally: `npm run build`

### Security Configuration: 🔒 Sandbox Support

Open Cowork provides **multi-level sandbox protection** to keep your system safe:

| Level        | Platform | Technology | Description                                    |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic**    | All      | Path Guard | File operations restricted to workspace folder |
| **Enhanced** | Windows  | WSL2       | Commands execute in isolated Linux VM          |
| **Enhanced** | macOS    | Lima       | Commands execute in isolated Linux VM          |
| **Enhanced** | Linux    | Docker / Podman | Commands execute inside an isolated Linux container |

- **Windows (WSL2)**: When WSL2 is detected, all Bash commands are automatically routed to a Linux VM. The workspace is synced bidirectionally.
- **macOS (Lima)**: When [Lima](https://lima-vm.io/) is installed (`brew install lima`), commands run in an Ubuntu VM with `/Users` mounted.
- **Linux (Docker / Podman)**: When Docker (or Podman) is detected, Open Cowork pulls `opencowork/sandbox:latest` from Docker Hub and runs all commands inside an isolated container. The workspace is bind-mounted at `/workspace` with `--cap-drop ALL` and `--security-opt no-new-privileges` for hard isolation.
- **Fallback**: If no VM/container is available, commands run natively with path-based restrictions.

**Setup (Optional, Recommended)**

- **Windows**: WSL2 is auto-detected if installed. [Install WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

- **macOS**:
  Lima is auto-detected if installed. Install command:

```bash
brew install lima
# Open Cowork will automatically create and manage a Lima VM (internal Lima name: 'claude-sandbox')
```

- **Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+ / Debian 12+ recommended)**:
  Download the `.AppImage` from Releases, then:

```bash
chmod +x "Open Cowork-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage"
./"Open Cowork-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage"   # double-click also works in most file managers
```

  Required libraries (already present on most modern distros): `libfuse2`, `libgtk-3-0`, `libnss3`, `libxss1`, `libasound2`. If AppImage fails to start, see the [AppImage troubleshooting docs](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/troubleshooting.html).

  **Recommended for sandbox isolation**: install Docker (or Podman). Open Cowork will auto-detect the engine at startup, pull the `opencowork/sandbox:latest` image from Docker Hub, and run all AI-executed commands inside the container. Without Docker, Linux falls back to basic path-based sandboxing.

```bash
# Optional but recommended (Ubuntu)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   # log out / log back in for group change
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Get an API Key

You need an API key to power the agent. We support **OpenRouter**, **Anthropic**, and various cost-effective **Chinese Models**.

| Provider           | Get Key / Coding Plan                                                      | Base URL (Required)                      | Recommended Model    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **OpenRouter**     | [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)                                       | `https://openrouter.ai/api`              | `claude-4-5-sonnet`  |
| **Anthropic**      | [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)                        | (Default)                                | `claude-4-5-sonnet`  |
| **Zhipu AI (GLM)** | [GLM Coding Plan](https://bigmodel.cn/glm-coding) (⚡️Chinese Deal)         | `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/anthropic` | `glm-4.7`, `glm-4.6` |
| **MiniMax**        | [MiniMax Coding Plan](https://platform.minimaxi.com/subscribe/coding-plan) | `https://api.minimax.io/anthropic`     | `minimax-m3`, `minimax-m2.7-highspeed`, `minimax-m2.5-highspeed`, `minimax-m2` |
| **Kimi**           | [Kimi Coding Plan](https://www.kimi.com/membership/pricing)                | `https://api.kimi.com/coding/`           | `kimi-k2`            |

### 2. Configure

1. Open the app and click the ⚙️ **Settings** icon in the bottom left.
2. Paste your **API Key**.
3. **Crucial**: Set the **Base URL** according to the table above (especially for Zhipu/MiniMax, etc.).
4. Enter the **Model** name you want to use.

### 3. Start Coworking

1. **Select a Workspace**: Choose a folder where Claude is allowed to work.
2. **Enter a Prompt**:
   > "Read the financial_report.csv in this folder and create a PowerPoint summary with 5 slides."

### 📝 Important Notes

1.  **macOS Installation**: If you downloaded the DMG directly (not via Homebrew) and see a security warning, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**. Or install via Homebrew to avoid this entirely:
    ```bash
    brew tap OpenCoworkAI/tap && brew install --cask --no-quarantine open-cowork
    ```
2.  **Network Access**: For tools like `WebSearch`, you may need to enable "Virtual Network Interface" (TUN Mode) in your proxy settings to ensure connectivity.
3.  **Notion Connector**: Besides setting the integration token, you also need to add connections in a root page. See https://www.notion.com/help/add-and-manage-connections-with-the-api for more details.

## ❓ FAQ

**What is Open Cowork?**
Open Cowork is a free, open-source desktop application that provides a local AI agent workspace. It wraps AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, etc.) into a GUI with one-click installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux — no terminal or coding knowledge required.

**How is Open Cowork different from Claude Cowork?**
Open Cowork is the open-source implementation of Claude Cowork. It adds multi-model support (not just Claude), GUI automation via computer use, remote control through Feishu/Slack, and VM-level sandbox isolation. See the [feature comparison table](#features) for details.

**What AI models does Open Cowork support?**
Claude (via Anthropic or OpenRouter), OpenAI-compatible APIs, and Chinese models including GLM (Zhipu AI), MiniMax, and Kimi. Any provider offering an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint can be configured.

**Is Open Cowork free?**
Yes. Open Cowork itself is completely free and open-source under the MIT license. You only need to pay for the AI model API usage from your chosen provider.

**Does Open Cowork work on Linux?**
Yes — Open Cowork ships a Linux `.AppImage` for x64 systems, alongside the Windows `.exe` and macOS `.dmg`. Download the latest `Open Cowork-<version>-linux-x64.AppImage` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/OpenCoworkAI/open-cowork/releases), make it executable (`chmod +x Open\ Cowork-*.AppImage`), and run it. For VM-level sandbox isolation, install Docker (or Podman) — Open Cowork auto-detects it and runs all commands inside the `opencowork/sandbox:latest` container.

**Linux GUI automation prerequisites:** Open Cowork's computer-use features (clicking, typing, key presses, screenshots) need a few system tools on `$PATH` on the host. The preflight check at startup will warn if any are missing; install the minimum set for your session:

| Display server | Required                  | Recommended for Wayland         |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **X11**        | `xdotool`, `grim` (or `scrot`) | —                          |
| **Wayland**    | `grim` (or `gnome-screenshot`) | `ydotool` + the `ydotoold` daemon |

Install on common families:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install xdotool grim scrot gnome-screenshot

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install xdotool grim scrot gnome-screenshot

# Arch
sudo pacman -S xdotool grim scrot gnome-screenshot
```

For Wayland input (click / type / key), `ydotool` needs the `ydotoold` user daemon running (`systemctl --user enable --now ydotoold`). Without it the GUI action dispatch throws a clear install-hint error pointing at the missing piece.

**How does sandbox isolation work?**
Open Cowork offers multi-level protection: basic path-based restrictions on all platforms, and enhanced VM-level isolation using WSL2 (Windows) or Lima (macOS). When a VM is available, all commands execute inside an isolated Linux environment, protecting your host system.

**What are Skills and how do I create custom ones?**
Skills are built-in workflows for specific tasks like generating PPTX, DOCX, PDF, or XLSX files. Open Cowork ships with default skills under `.claude/skills/` and includes a `skill-creator` tool to help you build your own custom skills.

**What is MCP and how does it work?**
MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI connect to external tools and services. Open Cowork supports MCP connectors for browsers, Notion, and other desktop apps — extending the AI's capabilities beyond just file management and code.

**How do I set up remote control via Feishu or Slack?**
Open Cowork supports remote control through Feishu (Lark) and Slack integration, allowing you to send commands and receive results from collaboration platforms. Check the app settings for remote control configuration.

**Is my data safe? Does Open Cowork send data to external servers?**
Open Cowork runs locally on your machine. Your files stay in your workspace. The only external communication is with the AI model API you configure (e.g., Anthropic, OpenRouter). No data is sent to Open Cowork servers.
